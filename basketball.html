        is a limited-contact sport played on a rectangular court."
        While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side,
        three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common.
        The objective is to shoot a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)
        through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high that is mounted to a
        backboard at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith.
